Hello :)

This is some kind of Puzzle game :)

I started it a little bit, it has 3 level, and you can put the pictures together and see when it is finished

I am still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Danilo Vesovic YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
